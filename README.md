# Artificial Intelligence Methods and Systems Laboratory Works

Welcome to the repository for the laboratory works completed as part of the "Methods and Systems of Artificial Intelligence" course at 
National Technical University of Ukraine ‚ÄúIgor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute‚Äù. This collection showcases a series of programs implemented in SWI Prolog, a powerful and versatile logic programming language.

## Overview

Each laboratory work corresponds to a specific topic covered in the "Methods and Systems of Artificial Intelligence" course. The programs are designed to demonstrate practical applications of the concepts learned during the lectures.

## Prerequisites

Before running the programs, make sure you have SWI Prolog installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official SWI Prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).

## Contribution

If you have suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features for any of the laboratory works, please feel free to submit a pull request. Contributions from the community are highly encouraged.
